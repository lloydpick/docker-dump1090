## Summary

The container provides you with the FlightAware dump1090 application. It has been tested with an RTL-SDR R820T2 RTL2832U device on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. There is a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/lloydpick/docker-spyserver/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file should you want to see how to correctly mount the USB device.

### Example

See [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/lloydpick/docker-dump1090/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

### Rebuilding

If you wish to rebuild this image for yourself, you can use the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/lloydpick/docker-dump1090/blob/master/Dockerfile) provided. However, the image that exists on DockerHub was built using the Docker experimental `buildx` functionality to build the `arm` version from a Mac. You can view the build command in the [Makefile](https://github.com/lloydpick/docker-dump1090/blob/master/Makefile).
